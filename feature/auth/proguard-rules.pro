# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can control the set of applied configuration files using the
# proguardFiles setting in build.gradle.

# Keep generic signature of Call, Response (R8 full mode strips signatures from non-kept items).
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowshrinking interface retrofit2.Call
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowshrinking class retrofit2.Response

# With R8 full mode generic signatures are stripped for classes that are not
# kept. Suspend functions are wrapped in continuations where the type argument
# is used.
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowshrinking class kotlin.coroutines.Continuation

# Keep Hilt
-keepclasseswithmembers class * extends androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel {
    <init>(javax.inject.Provider);
}

# Keep Compose
-keep class androidx.compose.** { *; }
-keepclassmembers class androidx.compose.** { *; }
